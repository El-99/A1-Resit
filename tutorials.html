        <h2>HTML Tutorial (For beginners):</h2>
        <p>
            Most of the stuff on the web is no different than the stuff on your computer — it’s just a whole load of files sorted into a whole load of directories.
            HTML files are nothing more than simple text files, so to start writing in HTML, you need nothing more than a simple text editor.</p>
            <p>
            The site we’ll be using for most of the content in this tutorial will be htmldog.com, be sure to visit the site as there is more resources available.
            The primary thing to keep in mind, the supermagic key, is that HTML is used for meaning and CSS is used for presentation. HTML is nothing more than fancy structured content and the visual formatting of that content will come later when we tackle CSS. You might find different approaches elsewhere on the web but HTML Dog focuses on best practice from the outset and getting into the frame of mind of doing things the right way from the start will lead to much better results in the end.

        <h2>User Interace Design:</h2>
        
        <p>For the user interface user design, we will focus on the material Design of the website. Material Design is a visual language that synthesizes the classic principles of good design with the innovation of technology and science.
            <br></br>
            <p>
            Material Design is inspired by the physical world and its textures, including how they reflect light and cast shadows. Material surfaces reimagine the mediums of paper and ink.
